# Evaluating QSVM's Scalability: A Comparative Analysis with Classical Support Vector Machines

## Introduction
SVMs are really useful machine learning algorithms. One of the main drawbacks of this algorithm is that it does not work for large-scale data. Quantum machine learning gives us the advantage of computing large-scale data with better efficiency using the kernel method.

## Research Question

Does QSVM solve the scalability issues of classical SVM ?

## Motivation
Resolving the scalability issues of SVM can pave the way for tackling more complex real-life classification problems. It will give useful insights into real-life bigger data. It will also become a very important application of quantum computaton. 


## Our Experiment:

To compare the scalability of SVM and QSVM, we implemented both classical and quantum SVM in the same dataset. We conducted some thorough literature reviews to understand the current state of this research.
The basic understanding of QSVM code was taken form this link:
- [Implementation of QSVM in Qiskit](https://github.com/Qiskit/platypus/blob/main/notebooks/summer-school/2021/resources/lab-notebooks/lab-3.ipynb )

### Table of comparison of different factors from literature review

| Paper Title | Approach | Data Size | Features | Feature Map | Scaling Performance | Other Results |
|-------------|----------|-----------|----------|-------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Quantum Support Vector Machine for Classification and Regression Problems | Hybrid | 1,000 samples | 10-12 (PCA reduced) | Angle Embedding (RX/RY) | Classical better | Better classification metrics |
| Quantum Support Vector Machine for Big Data Classification | Hybrid | <500 samples | N/A | Not specified | Classical better | No QSVM advantages |
| An Enhanced Approach for Predicting Air Pollution Using Quantum Support Vector Machine | Hybrid | 500-2,000 | Multiple indicators | Custom quantum map | Not compared | Better prediction accuracy |
| Quantum Machine Learning for Finance: Short-Term Stock Price Prediction | Hybrid | Large scale | 20+ | Hardware-efficient | QSVM scaled better | Quantum advantage (>50 qubits) |
## Future investigations:
In our study , we saw that classical SVM had better scaling in case of small scale data. Incase of middle and large scale data , the prediction of QSVMs were better. In one of the cases for a very large scale data, QSVM showed better scaling. More experiments on real life very large data datasets should be done for reaching a conclusion in this matter . We used only hybrid approaches in our study. Fully Quantum approaches can give different results
